- Undergraduate compsci student somewhere.
- **Current interest (long term)**: Programming languages, logic, type theory
- **Current interest (short term)**: Formal proofs, hardware design (FPGA stuff)
- **Future directions** considered but haven't touched yet: computer education
- **Pronouns**: `dram` is short enough

<sub>âš¡ Fun fact: I was not even aware of the concept of dynamic RAM when I came up with `dramforever`. But I do hope one day technology falsifies my name by inventing something better.</sub>
